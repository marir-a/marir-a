### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm marir.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working as Java Software Developer and studying at the UoL.

ðŸŒ± Apart from it I'm mostly just trying new things to expand my knowledge of different Computer Science fields.

ðŸ¤” I also really love adding these emojis.

You can check out my university projects (code is not public):
- https://marir-a.github.io/2d-platform-game/ 
  This is a simple one level game written on JS with p5js library.
- https://marir-a.github.io/language-learning-site/
  My first try on WebDev ðŸ˜„ Well there's a room for improvement. Used basic HTML and CSS.
